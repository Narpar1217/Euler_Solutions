In this repository are my solutions to select problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net).
Project Euler "is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs" (from Wikipedia). 
The goal is to write a program for each problem, in any language, that solves it in less than one minute.

All are verified to compile in gcc 3.4.4 (in Cygwin) without any warnings or errors using the following flags: -O -Wall -std=c99

As of 4/6/2013 I have solved 40 out of 421 problems.
More solutions will be added here as they are reviewed, and as time permits.
