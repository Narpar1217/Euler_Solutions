In this repository are my solutions to select problems from Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net).
Project Euler "is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs" (from Wikipedia). 
The goal is to write a program for each problem, in any language, that solves it in less than one minute.

As of 4/6/2013 I have solved 40 out of 421 problems, mostly in Python.
More solutions will be added here as they are reviewed, and as time permits.
